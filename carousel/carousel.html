                Voltaj was formed in 1982, in Bucharest, by Horațiu Rad on bass, Nikki Dinescu on drums, Gabi Nacu
                on guitar, Cristi Minculescu on vocals and Adrian Ilie on guitar. Their sound at
                the time was on the heavier side of hard rock, being one of the earliest examples of traditional heavy
                metal
                in the Romanian scene.
                As one of the most important pop-rock bands in Romania, Voltaj have been a mainstay of the Romanian
                charts, radio and public events for more than 20 years. This year they won the Romanian national
                Eurovision final with the song ‘De La Capat’ which has a strong message supporting children who have
                been left alone by their parents working abroad.
                The band have played in many countries including Moldova, Austria, Italy, Spain and Ireland, playing
                well over usually a hundred concerts a year. Voltaj have received several awards over the years
                including the Best Romanian Act in the MTV Europe Music Awards in 2005.
                In 2014 the band started a campaign delecapat.ro (alloveragain) supporting children left alone by their
                parents who have travelled abroad to work outside Romania. They are now connected with other major child
                protection non-profit organisations like Unitedway and Habitat for Humanity.
            <p>
                They won the Best Romanian Act award at the MTV Europe Music Awards 2005. They also represented Romania
                in
                the Eurovision Song Contest 2015 with the song "De la capăt".
